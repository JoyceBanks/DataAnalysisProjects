In my first attempt at using pandas, I wrote this code to analyze squirrel data from a CSV file. It reads the data into a pandas DataFrame, 
counts the occurrences of different primary fur colors ("Black," "Gray," and "Cinnamon"), and stores the counts in a new DataFrame. 
Finally, it exports the color count data to a CSV file named "squirrel_count.csv."
